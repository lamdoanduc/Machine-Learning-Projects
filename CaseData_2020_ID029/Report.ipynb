    "# REPORT OF CASE STUDY - 2020_ID029\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shows the business performance of an online shop in 2018. The shop manager has noticed anomalies in their ERP reports, and she is worried about the reliability of the data. The data consists of three dataset: CustomerData, ItemData, and TransactionData. The case-study goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (1) We need to understand the data and develop a comprehensive understanding of the information provided.\n",
    "* (2) From this understanding we need to identify anomalies, consider important relationships, and report on any concern.\n",
    "* (3) If the anomalies can be normalized in order to add value to the company.\n",
    "* (4) We might be asked to re-perform this check in the future. Therefore, consider creating a solution that can be reused for similar clients.\n",
    "* (5) What opportunities can be identified from the data that can provide value to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used Python for the exploratory data analysis (with Pandas) and visualization (with Seaborn). I have also reproduced the python plots in Tableau and made interactive dashboards for the presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have utilized ML models in Python to make predictive analysis. The models were used to predict whether the customers eventually decided to purchase items that they had ordered.  Support Vector Classifier was selected to perform the predictive analysis. For a comparison, I have also done a logistic regression model that was trained and tested using the same data samples. \n",

    "## 1. The CustomerData dataset\n",
    "        \n",
    " The database contains information about the shop customers: COUNTRY, EDUCATION, GENDER, and DAY OF BIRTH. The customer data is visualized in the below dashboard. Click [Here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/duc.lam#!/vizhome/CustomerData_CaseStudy_2020_ID029/Dashboard1) to see an interactive version of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    " The customers come from 45 countries (regions) as shown at the geographical plot in the dashboard. The top countries (regions) having the highest numbers of customers can be seen in the table on the dashboard.\n",
    " \n",
    " A significant fraction of the customers is female (about 53%, the upper-right plot). The customer ages are from 17 to 55 yrs, and have the peak distribution at around 36 yrs (the upper right plot). There is no significant difference in customer education as seen in the lower right plot. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. The ItemData dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains information about the selling products (ITEM), CATEGORY, supplier (SUPLID), COLOR, PURCHASEPRICE, and SALEPRICE. The dataset has many duplicated rows. The data preprocessing was done before visualization as shown in the python code at the end of this report. A short summary of the dataset is visualized in the below dashboard (click [Here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/duc.lam#!/vizhome/Itemdata_CaseStudy_2020_ID029/Dashboard1) for an interactive version). \n",
    " \n",
    "The stacked-bar chart (upper-left chart) shows the number of unique items with different colors at each category. All the categories have more GULD items than other color ones. Dress, scarf, and belt have the highest numbers of unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sale price does not show a significant difference between categories (upper-right box plot). The median value of STOCKINGS sale price is even higher than that of DRESS and COAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit of each unique item is calculated by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. The profit distribution of each unique item at categories is shown in the lower box plot on the dashboard. The whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR. DRESS, HAT, and BELT have many outliners on the positive side. This means the categories have high-profit items. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. The TransactionsData dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains information about the customer ID (USERID), the ITEMs, number of ITEMs, the PAYMENT method, time of the transactions, RATING, REVIEW from the customers, and delivery (SHIPDAYS, TIMESTAMP). The data preprocessing was performed before visualization as shown in the python code at the end of this report. The data was visualized in the dashboard 3 and 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are more than 2 million transactions in the data. It is almost the same number of transactions using different payment methods (upper-left pie chart). The shipments might take up to 10 days (upper-middle pie chart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately, 40% of the transactions, the customers left reviews (upper-right pie chart). The ratings are shown in the lower-right bar chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is about 40% of transactions that were done via mobile app compared to about 53% via web browsers. The shop may want to improve and deploy its mobile app. \n",

    "\n",
    "The calculated total profit by countries (regions) can be seen in a table in the dashboard 4. The calculation only counts for transactions marked by 'YES' in the PURCHASE field, e.g., only transactions that customers decided to purchase eventually. Macedonia and Martinique having the highest numbers of customers are found at the top of the total profit table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total profit by categories is shown in the upper-right bar chart. The DRESS category brought the most profit to the shop. The total profit was also calculated for each providing braches (lower-right bar chart). \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the lower-left bar chart, the data does not contain any information about business performance in June, August, and September. This would be a fault in the data collection. The highest profit is in May. \n",

    "# Predictive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select model\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the selected ML models are to _(1)_ predict whether the customers eventually decided to purchase items that they had ordered and _(2)_ which factors (fields) will affect the customer's decision, e.g. the total amount of the transaction, quantity of ordered items, etc. This may help the shop to improve its services and make better business performance in the future. Support Vector Classifier was selected to the perform predictive analysis. Besides, a logistic regression model was also carried out for a comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction data includes more than 2 million observations (rows). Because of the time limitation and the computer capacity, a random sample of only 20% of all transactions in the transaction database was used to train the model. The head of the data is shown in the following table. \n",

    "_The head of data used to train the model._\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary data of the 'REVIEW' and 'PURCHASE' fields are resulted by mapping the value of 0 to 'NO', and the value of 1 to 'YES' in the columns in the provided data. The multiple dummy variables ('BIANCA', 'ISABELLA', 'KENZA', 'KEVIN', 'NO', and 'SENDI') are resulted by splitting the 'PPC_ADD' column from the provided data. The target that the models try to predict is the 'PURCHASE' feature. The data was split into a train set and a test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Classifier model has RBF kernal. To optimize the values of the regularization parameter (C) and the Kernel coefficient (gamma) for the model inputs, I used a built-in function called GridSearchCV. This perform an exhaustive search over specified parameter values ({'C': 0.1,1,10,100,1000,'gamma': 1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001}). \n",
