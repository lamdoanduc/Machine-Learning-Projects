# Machine-Learning-Projects
This respository stores the porjects that I have gone through and found very interested in spending time with. I am still working on some of them to improve the perfomances.

Each project is stored in a folder contaning a README.md file, data, and a code in Jupyter Notebook. The prjoect goal, method, requirement, and summary can be found in the README.md file.
