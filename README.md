# Machine-Learning-Projects
### This repository stores the projects that I have gone through and found very interested in spending time with. I am still working on some of them to improve the performances.

### Each project is stored in a folder containing a README.md file, data, and code in Jupyter Notebook. The project goal, method, requirement, and summary can be found in the README.md file.
